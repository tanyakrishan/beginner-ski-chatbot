              It is in the format of value groups with the following syntax:
              "//GoogleValueGroups/Locations/LOCATION" Where LOCATION can
              either be "Mandatory/version_number_here"
              (the locations which are required for inclusion for all customers)
              or a specific country-based location.
              Note the Mandatory Locations value group will be versioned to
              allow Google to remove locations from this group without causing
              breaking changes.
              Examples:
              "//GoogleValueGroups/Locations/Mandatory/v1".
              "//GoogleValueGroups/Locations/US".
              "//GoogleValueGroups/Locations/JP".
