    brief: Delete a machine learning run
    description: Delete a machine learning run.
    examples: |-
      To delete the machine learning run, run:

          $ {command} my-run --location=us-central1
  arguments:
    params:
    - help_text: |-
        projects/{project}/locations/{location}/machineLearningRuns/{machineLearningRun}
      is_positional: true
      is_primary_resource: true
      resource_spec: !REF googlecloudsdk.command_lib.mldiagnostics.machine_learning_run.v1alpha_resources:projects_locations_machine_learning_runs
      required: true
    - arg_name: force
      api_field: force
      action: store_true
      required: false
      default: false
      type: bool
      help_text: |-
        If force=false and if a user tries to delete an ml run resource that still
        has child resources (e.g., ProfilerTarget), the request should fail with a
        FAILED_PRECONDITION error.
        If force=true, the delete request should delete both parent and child
        resources that exist.
